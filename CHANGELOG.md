## Modularization
[x] Spells are now fully "pickable" in the Launcher.

---

## Naming Conventions
[x] All file and directory names have been standardized to begin with lowercase letters. Names with multiple words are now using camelCase for improved clarity (the previous structure was somewhat chaotic). This consistency simplified shell scripts I used for organizing the structure.

---

## Path Fixes
[ ] **Spell Paths**: Resolved incorrect spell paths. (stalled)
[ ] **Icon Paths**: Corrected various icon paths. (stalled)
[ ] **Translation Paths**: Fixed issues with translation paths. (work in progress)

---

## Documentation Updates
[ ] Added a **README.md** to the GitHub repository.
[ ] Included documentation for the mod in the VCMI Launcher (in English).
[x] Created dedicated folders for sound assets.

---

## TODOs
[ ] **Fix Warnings and Errors** in the log file (not attributed to my work):
	`WARN [initialize] mod - Spell: target type empty - assumed NO_TARGET.`
	`ERROR [initialize] mod - Spell: no positiveness specified, assumed NEUTRAL.`

[ ] **Decide on Comments**: Consider whether to remove deprecated aiValue comments.

---

## Note
While working on the project, I noticed that naming files like `spellIcon.png` instead of `spellIconBenediction.png` could create simpler and more recognizable patterns.
