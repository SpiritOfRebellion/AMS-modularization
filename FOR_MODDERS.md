1. Mod is standarized for camelCase naming convention to files and folders to avoid typos and make easier to edit mod with scripts

2. Icons will replace each other if won't be in its folder, for example: 
accuracy/content/sprites/**accuracy**/*.png',
clarity/content/sprites/**clarity**/*.png

// accuracy.json

graphics: {
	
}
